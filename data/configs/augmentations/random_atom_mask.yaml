# Random atom masking replaces selected node attributes with a mask token.
# In the graph representation, the atoms are still there, but masked atoms are all represented by the same token.
# - p: Proportion of atom to mask, ie 0.3 will mask 30\% of the atoms, default: 1.0
# - input_field: The name of the input to use the augmentation on. It should be the same as the output field of a graph featurization.

augmentations:
  - type: "random_atom_mask"
    p: 0.3
    input_field: "ligand"
