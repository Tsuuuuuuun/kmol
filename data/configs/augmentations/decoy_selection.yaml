# Decoy selection is a `static_augmentation` while there can be some randomness the data will be added
# only once at the beginning of the training and will not change.
# The decoy selection computes the tanimoto similarity score between all 
# combinations of ligand, decoy pair provided. (Morgan Fingerprint is used)

# Since this operation can take time, we enable the possibility to launch it as a separate script 
# or to launch it at the start of the training. 
# In both cases, it will generate a `result_tanimoto_score.csv` file which will be loaded on the following runs.
# If the user wants to add values to the `result_tanimoto_score.csv` he can run the script on a subset of the dataset. However, he will have to manually combine both files.


# - decoy_to_add: Define which type of decoy to add to the dataset, either positive, negative or all.
# - negative_threshold: Tanimoto similarity threshold under which a decoy is considered negative. Default: 0.3
# - positive_threshold: Tanimoto similarity threshold over which a decoy is considered positive.  Default: 0.5
# - data_loader_smile_field: Name of the dataset column containing the smiles.
# - data_loader_target_field: Name of the dataset column containing the protein sequence.
# - script_file_path: (Optional) Fill either this parameter or `cfg_script`. Path to an output of the `decoy_similarity` script.
# - cfg_script: (Optional) Fill either this parameter or `script_file_path`. Dict containing information to generate the `decoy_similarity` script.
# - featurization_jobs: number of workers to use for this job. default: `featurization_jobs` of the general configuration file.
