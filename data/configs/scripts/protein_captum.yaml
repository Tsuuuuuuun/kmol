# This script can be used to get the explanability of a schnet model.
# 
# In the case of primary sequence input, featurization using one-hot is mandatory, 
# feature quantification is to hard to map using bag-of-words, etc.
# In the case of complex 3D structure input, the contribution is stored in the B-factor column of pdb.

# ProteinCaptumScript: Generate the integrated gradient attribution of the input
# embeddings as well as the ligand-protein interaction edges. The attribution of the
# edge is distributed to each atom where an atom's final attribution will be the sum
# of its embedding as well as half of all the ligand-protein interaction attribution the
# atom is related to.

# - `config_path`: is the config of them model with information about the `checkpoint_path` to be
#   loaded as well as the `output_path` and the dataset information to run the script.
#   Similar to what an evaluation config will look like.

# WARNING: The data to be evaluated needs to be in the `test` split of the dataset.
#           Usually define in the splitter.
