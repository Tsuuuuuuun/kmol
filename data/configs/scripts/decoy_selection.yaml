# The decoy selection computes the tanimoto similarity score between all combinations of ligand, decoy pair provided.


# The script will compute the Tanimoto similiraty between a group of molecules
# and a decoy set. 
# It will filter the data in data_loader containing set of protein /
# molecule dataset based on the protein contains in target_loader. The output
# is a csv file with the following format: 
# smiles, decoy smiles, tanimoto score

# The various column inputs / outputs of the loaders should match. Their content will
# be compared and regrouped during the decoy similarity computation. For example,
# the target sequence in the target loader should have the same format as the target
# in data_loader.
# - `target_loader`: Loader configuration for the target dataset. This dataset
# is used to filter out the data_loader dataset and keep only the target inside
# target_loader.
# - `decoy_loader`: A loader's config format for the decoy dataset. This dataset
# contains all the decoy molecules we want to use in order to augment our
# dataset.
# - `data_loader`: A loader config for the overall molecule / target dataset.
# - `fingerprint_radius`: Radius of the featurization Morgan fingerprint is used. default: 2.
